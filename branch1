Failed Enterprise System Implementation: Hershey’s 1999 ERP Disaster
Company Overview

Company Name: Hershey’s
Industry: Food & Confectionery
Reason for Implementation:
Hershey’s was looking to replace its old legacy systems with an advanced ERP system to streamline operations.
The company sought improved business processes, better data access, and faster decision-making.
It aimed to better manage its supply chain and distribution to meet increased demand.
Implementation Process & Challenges

Hershey’s encountered major challenges in 1999 during their implementation of SAP’s ERP system.
The implementation was rushed, and the company attempted to roll out the new system in an accelerated timeline to meet business demands.
Technical issues arose with integration, especially with legacy systems and the new ERP platform.
User training was insufficient, leading to confusion among employees about the new processes and system interfaces.
Communication between project teams, technical experts, and stakeholders was fragmented, and many challenges were not anticipated.
Key Failure Factors

Weak Planning and Strategy: The project was rushed to meet a strict deadline, leading to poor planning and a lack of proper risk mitigation.
Inadequate Training: Employees were not properly trained on the new system, leading to user errors and confusion.
Poor Integration: The ERP system struggled to integrate with Hershey's existing supply chain and legacy systems.
Lack of Change Management: Hershey's failed to manage resistance to change and didn’t sufficiently engage employees in the process.
Budget Overruns and Missed Deadlines: The project went over budget and missed deadlines, leading to significant operational disruptions.
Outcomes & Consequences

Hershey’s experienced major operational disruptions due to poor inventory management and inadequate system integration.
The company faced delayed shipments and a significant loss of sales, estimated at over $100 million in lost revenue.
Employee frustration due to system errors led to decreased productivity.
Reputational damage and financial losses were substantial, and Hershey’s had to abandon certain aspects of the implementation and revert to manual processes.
The company later had to invest heavily in fixing the ERP system, which delayed the realization of benefits.
